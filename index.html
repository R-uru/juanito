Have I ever told you
I want you to the bone?
Have I ever called you
When you are all alone?
And if I ever forget
To tell you how I feel
Listen to me now, babe
I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I want you to the bone, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maybe if you can see
What I feel through my bone
Every corner in me
There's your presence that grown
Maybe I nurture it more
By saying how I feel
But I did mean it before
I want you to the bone
I want you to-
Take me home, I'm fallin'
<span>love</span> me long, I'm rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, you call and
I'll take control your body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Would that be alright?
Hey, would that be alright?
I want you to the bone, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So bad I can't breathe, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
I want you to the bone
Of all the ones that begged to stay
I'm still longing for you
Of all the ones that cried their way
I'm still waiting on you
Maybe we seek for something that
We couldn't ever have
Maybe we choose the only <span>love</span>
We know we won't accept
Or maybe we're taking all the risks
For somethin' that is real
'Cause maybe the greatest <span>love</span> of all
Is who the eyes can't see, yeah
Take me home, I'm fallin'
<span>love</span> me long, I'm rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, I call and
I'll take control of your body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours, oh
Oh, yes
I want you to the bone, yeah
I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone, yeah
I want you to the bone, bone, ooh
I want you to the bone
Have I ever told you
I want you to the bone?
